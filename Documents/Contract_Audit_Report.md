# NLOV Token Audit Report
**Date**: August 13, 2024
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Token Standard**: SPL (Solana)
**Total Supply**: 500,000,000
**Contract Type**: Vesting, Distribution, Token

## 1. CRITICAL SECURITY CHECKPOINTS

### 1.1 Initial Parameters Verification
```solidity
Max Supply: 500,000,000 (FIXED)
Decimals: 9
Initial Circulating: 59.8M (11.96%)
Owner Address: Requires Multi-sig
Transfer Restrictions: Active during vesting
```

### 1.2 High-Risk Areas Identified
- TGE unlock mechanism needs rate limiting
- Team wallet concentration risk
- Linear vesting calculation precision
- Potential front-running in public sale
- CEX listing token distribution mechanism

### 1.3 Contract Access Controls
```markdown
CRITICAL ACCESS ROLES:
- Contract Owner
- Treasury Manager
- Emergency Admin
- Vesting Controller
- Staking Manager
```

## 2. VESTING IMPLEMENTATION AUDIT

### 2.1 Cliff Periods Verification
```javascript
Team: 12 months ✓
Strategic: 12 months ✓
Advisors: 6 months ✓
Treasury: 4 months ✓
Ecosystem: 5 months ✓
R&D: 3 months ✓
```

### 2.2 Linear Vesting Formula
```python
monthly_unlock = total_allocation * (time_elapsed / total_vesting_period)
if time < cliff_period:
    return 0
if time > vesting_end:
    return total_allocation
```

### 2.3 Release Schedule Validation
```javascript
TGE Release: {
    public_sale: allocation * 0.5,
    treasury: allocation * 0.1,
    ecosystem: allocation * 0.05,
    marketing: allocation * 0.1,
    liquidity: allocation * 0.2,
    staking: allocation * 0.05
}
```

## 3. SMART CONTRACT VULNERABILITIES CHECK

### 3.1 Critical Functions
```solidity
function release() external {
    require(block.timestamp >= cliff, "Cliff not reached");
    require(msg.sender == beneficiary, "Not beneficiary");
    require(!paused, "Contract paused");
    // Additional checks needed
}
```

### 3.2 Required Security Features
- Emergency pause mechanism
- Token recovery function
- Ownership transfer safety
- Vesting schedule modification locks
- Anti-whale measures

## 4. EMISSION SCHEDULE VERIFICATION

### 4.1 Monthly Unlock Calculations
```javascript
Month 1-3: Base unlock (11.96%) + Linear(public_sale)/3
Month 4-6: Previous + Linear(presale)/4
Month 7-12: Previous + Linear(treasury, marketing)/respective_periods
Month 13-24: Previous + Linear(team, strategic)/36
Month 25-36: Continue Linear(team, treasury, strategic)
Month 37-48: Final Linear(ecosystem, staking)
```

### 4.2 Critical Points Analysis
```markdown
HIGH ATTENTION POINTS:
1. Month 3: Public sale complete (Selling pressure)
2. Month 12: Team unlock starts (Volume spike)
3. Month 24: Marketing complete (Strategy shift)
4. Month 36: Major unlocks complete (Price impact)
```

## 5. RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS

### 5.1 Security Enhancements
```markdown
1. Implement timelock for owner functions
2. Add multi-sig requirement for >1M token transfers
3. Include emergency freeze per allocation bucket
4. Add dynamic vesting based on price impact
5. Implement transfer rate limiting
```

### 5.2 Contract Optimization
```markdown
1. Batch release function for gas optimization
2. Memory usage optimization in calculations
3. Event emission optimization
4. Storage slot optimization
```

## 6. COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

### 6.1 Required Functions
```solidity
- pause()
- unpause()
- updateBeneficiary()
- emergencyWithdraw()
- updateVestingSchedule()
- recoverTokens()
```

### 6.2 Required Events
```solidity
event TokensReleased(address beneficiary, uint256 amount);
event VestingScheduleUpdated(address beneficiary, uint256 newAmount);
event BeneficiaryUpdated(address oldBeneficiary, address newBeneficiary);
event EmergencyWithdraw(address admin, uint256 amount);
```

## 7. RISK ASSESSMENT

### 7.1 High Severity Risks
1. Centralization in team allocation
2. Front-running potential in public sale
3. Cliff bypass vulnerability
4. Emergency function abuse
5. Price manipulation during large unlocks

### 7.2 Medium Severity Risks
1. Gas optimization in batch releases
2. Rounding errors in vesting calculation
3. Timestamp manipulation risk
4. Token recovery edge cases
5. Multi-sig complexity

## 8. AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS

### 8.1 Immediate Actions
```markdown
1. Implement transfer delays for large amounts
2. Add price impact circuit breakers
3. Enhance emergency pause granularity
4. Add vesting schedule modification timelock
5. Implement progressive unlock thresholds
```

### 8.2 Long-term Suggestions
```markdown
1. Increase vesting periods for large holders
2. Add governance voting delay
3. Implement automated buyback mechanism
4. Add dynamic emission based on utility metrics
5. Create holder incentive programs
```

## 9. POST-AUDIT MONITORING

### 9.1 Key Metrics to Track
```markdown
1. Daily token velocity
2. Wallet concentration
3. DEX liquidity depth
4. Price impact per trade
5. Holder distribution curve
```

### 9.2 Alert Triggers
```markdown
1. >1% supply movement
2. >5% price impact trades
3. >10% holder concentration
4. Unusual vesting claims
5. Large wallet accumulation
```
