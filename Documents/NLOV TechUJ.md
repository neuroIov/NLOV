# Neurolov Implementation Architecture & User Journey

## Core Technical Components

The Neurolov platform will be implemented as a distributed system with several key layers:

1. **Browser-Based Compute Layer**
- WebGPU/WebGL implementation for GPU access through modern browsers
- Real-time hardware capability detection and benchmarking
- Sandboxed execution environment for compute tasks
- Dynamic resource allocation based on device capabilities
- Fallback mechanisms for older browsers using WebGL 2.0

2. **Blockchain Integration Layer**
- Dual-chain architecture utilizing Solana (primary) and TON (secondary)
- Smart contracts for:
  * Resource validation and registration
  * Proof of Computation consensus
  * Task distribution and validation
  * Payment processing and rewards
  * Node reputation tracking
  * Dispute resolution
- Cross-chain bridges for enhanced liquidity and interoperability

3. **Resource Management Layer**
- Distributed task scheduler using Kubernetes
- Real-time node health monitoring
- Dynamic pricing based on supply/demand
- Resource allocation optimization algorithms
- Task queue management and prioritization
- Performance metrics tracking

## Stakeholder Journeys
