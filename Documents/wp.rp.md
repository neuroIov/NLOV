Resource providers (GPU/CPU owners) begin by accessing the platform through a WebGPU-enabled browser, where they undergo device verification through a proof-of-computation protocol. This verification process uses WebGPU to benchmark the device's capabilities, creating a unique device fingerprint that's registered on the Solana blockchain. The device metadata and performance metrics are stored in an SPL token-gated smart contract.

The network operates on a hybrid architecture - with the core coordination happening on Solana for high-speed transaction processing (allocations, payments, reputation) and TON handling the distributed compute task management due to its infinite sharding capabilities. When a provider's device is verified, they receive a non-transferable NFT representing their compute node, which tracks their contribution history and reputation.

AI developers and institutions submit tasks through a specialized interface where they define compute requirements, timeline, and budget. These requirements are converted into smart contracts that specify task parameters, validation criteria, and reward distribution. The platform's task scheduler, implemented as a Solana program, uses an advanced scoring algorithm that considers node reputation, historical performance, and current network conditions to optimally distribute tasks.

The WebGPU compute pipeline handles task execution in sandboxed environments within the browser, using a custom shader system that supports both general-purpose computing and AI-specific operations. Results are validated through a distributed consensus mechanism where multiple nodes verify outputs before rewards are distributed. The proof-of-computation protocol ensures honest participation by requiring nodes to demonstrate actual work performed.

Resource pricing follows a dynamic model based on network demand, GPU capability, and historical reliability. Smart contracts automatically handle payments in NLOV tokens, with instant settlements on Solana and periodic batch settlements for compute rewards. Providers earn additional reputation points for consistent uptime and successful task completions, which increases their task allocation priority and reward multipliers.

For machine learning workloads, the platform implements a specialized task distribution system that breaks down training jobs into parallelizable components. Models and datasets are stored in a decentralized manner across the network using TON Storage, with only hashes and access controls managed on Solana. This enables efficient data streaming to compute nodes while maintaining security.

The entire ecosystem is bound together by the NLOV token, which serves multiple purposes:
- Payment for compute resources
- Staking for node operators (required for participation)
- Governance rights for protocol parameters
- Rewards for consistent and reliable performance

A sophisticated monitoring system tracks real-time metrics including node health, network latency, task completion rates, and token velocity. This data feeds into an AI-driven optimization engine that continuously adjusts task allocation strategies and pricing models to maximize network efficiency.

The security architecture implements multiple layers of protection:
- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving computation
- Secure enclaves for sensitive workloads
- Rate limiting and anti-spam measures
- Automated fraud detection using ML models
- Multi-signature controls for critical protocol functions

Through this architecture, Neurolov creates a trustless, efficient marketplace for distributed computing resources, with built-in incentives for honest participation and high performance. The combination of WebGPU's browser-based compute capabilities, Solana's high-speed consensus, and TON's scalable storage provides the technical foundation for a truly decentralized compute sharing economy.
